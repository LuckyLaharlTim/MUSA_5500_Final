    **PLEASE HAVE YOUR AGENT READ THE AGENT NOTES BEFORE SCHEDULING A SHOWING** Welcome to 117 S. Beechwood--a gorgeous, Trinity style revival in the heart of Rittenhouse Square. Located in one of the most "walkable" neighborhoods in downtown Philadelphia, this home captures the true essence of old world elegance with a mid-century modern flair. Pass through the arch top entryway door and you will find yourself on the main level, littered with luxurious appointments and hand crafted woodwork where no attention to detail has been spared. Take note of the fine, custom fireplace mantle, custom built-in bookshelves, and real, hardwood floors. The kitchen is light and airy, tastefully adorned with  stainless steel appliances, a built -in wine chiller, fine quartz countertops, and a marvelous herringbone backsplash with gold inlays. The gold hardware combined with black faucet and pot filler compliment one another and "pop" against the pristine white surroundings. Walk through to the far side of the kitchen and exit to a quaint, idyllic courtyard, perfect for relaxing and unwinding after a night out on the town, or entertaining during the warmer months.  Proceed up the open tread staircase to the second level where you will find the first bedroom, and a beautiful bathroom with Calacatta floors and walls in the oversized shower. The gold accents with custom glass shower doors add an element of depth to the space.  The bedroom on this level boasts a second fireplace with custom woodwork, plenty of closet space with built-in organization, and arched double French doors leading to a mezzanine balcony. Continue up to the third level where you find yourself in the generously sized master suite, accentuated by exposed brick walls, vaulted ceilings, and lastly, an enviable master bath with black marble floors and walls, a soaking tub, and separate shower area with, "rain" shower head.  Finally, make your way back down and descend to the lower level, a bonus finished basement that is home to another tastefully done sitting area that is limited only by your imagination; home office, wine cellar, exercise room, play room, or even home theater, you're sure to find a use for this unexpected useable space! This is one of the BEST available locations in the city, walk to everything, with close proximity to world class dining and entertainment, shopping, CHOP and some of the best medical facilities in the nation, UPenn and Drexel universities, Comcast Center and a multitude of other major corporate enterprises, and conveniently within minutes of arterial highways and the Philadelphia International Airport. To top it off, the sellers have already taken the time to have the home inspected, HVAC system serviced (and given a bill of clean health), and have cured the majority of the minor defects that were found. As an added bonus, and to further allay the most discriminating buyer's concerns, they are including a 1-Year American Home Shield Warranty for total buyer peace of mind. Make your best offer with confidence, this rare find won't last.
