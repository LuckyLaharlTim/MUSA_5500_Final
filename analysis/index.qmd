# Analysis


<!-- start of recommended new text -->



This section focuses on the process in acquiring, formatting, and examining the data gather from our analysis. 
Here we look at the methods in acquiring the data, the experimentation through the data cleaning process, and the results found after visualizing the data onto Philadelphia. 

The Analysis is broken down into 4 sections briefly described below.

### Methods

An explanation of the techniques used and their intended incorporation to create commercial corridor profiles is found here.

### Data Preparation

The process used to collect data from the Yelp API and Zillow is described with supporting source code provided.

### Exploratory Analysis

Given the main breadth of analysis on amenity classification, this section shows visualizations and brief discussion on 
the main types of individual business point data as well as introductory cluster analysis of them and areal units they are found within.

Other details like correlations of amenity frequencies and general distributions are also included.

### Zillow Description Cross-Reference

This secition provides descriptions of how the Zillow listing description text is used alongside the Yelp data. 
Notably, a sample cluster analysis of Philadelphia neighborhoods is provided 
suggesting a cross-referenced output of what types of amenities a neighborhood might be known for.

To clarify, the incorporation of the Zillow data is not comprehensive to the same standard as the Yelp data, 
but it serves as a useful proof of concept for cross-reference with larger numbers of listings and more attention taken to communicate provided insights.
