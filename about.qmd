Our project aims to develop a tool that will enable prospective renters, newcomers, tourists, and others to comprehensively understand what different Philadelphia neighborhoods have to offer. 
By using Zillow and Yelp data, we will leverage the most up-to-date amenity data as well as local knowledge about the most valued amenities in each neighborhood. 
This tool will allow us to highlight neighborhood assets rather than ranking neighborhoods against each other, and showcase the best amenities each neighborhood has to offer.
The showcase in this data will result in an interactive map series that allows users to explore the variation of amenity profiles throughout the city neighborhoods. 
Users will be able to select their amenity of interest through a wide variety of categories, broad and specific, and learn where they are located citywide.
