      "\tdescription: Get ready to be swept off your feet by this absolute gem of a home! Nestled in the middle of a small side street and unattached on the West side, this home has all of the extra windows and sunlight of a corner property with the privacy and charm of mid-block because of the adjoining lot that is used for private parking and will never be built on! Yes, this expanded trinity has windows on three sides, three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, an open first floor, and a large backyard with a deck and lawn. Originally built in the 1860s for workers at the navy yard that was then at the end of the block, this little workhorse has been brilliantly updated with loads of storage and original details.  The open living, dining room, and kitchen are perfect for quiet nights or hosting gatherings with friends and family. Gleaming new wood floors, floating wooden shelves for your teacup collection, and large windows make the space bright and airy. It feels minimal and modern while providing ample storage space. As you wander through the kitchen, you can head out onto your very own decked-in yard. After many trials and tribulations, the previous owners found the perfect tree that has been growing and thriving, so you get plenty of shade while you spend time outside.   Let's journey upstairs, shall we? This home is rare because it offers windows on three sides, almost unheard of in row home life. The bedrooms have tons of light streaming through. And the bathroom? It's like a moody spa: tile floors, a modern vanity with plenty of storage, and mini subway marble tiles around the tub that's just begging for a bubble bath.   Make your way to the third floor to find the two other bedrooms. The first, closest to the stairs, is perfect for your kiddo or an office. It’s on the smaller side, but the large window makes it a cheery place all day. The third bedroom is a fantastic size, easily fitting a queen bed. Two windows drench the room in light. Both bedrooms have vaulted ceilings with large lofts that could be used for storage or move beds up for the best naps. The exposed brick adds to the charming and historic feel of the home! Oh, and there's another full bathroom because this place understands vertical living.  The house itself is enough to make the move, but the neighborhood will seal the deal. Pennsport is loved for its proximity to parks, transportation (95 is just a few blocks away for easy access), waterfront running paths, not to mention coffee shops galore. As current residents of this neighborhood, we can assure you that it has so much to offer regarding food, coffee, bars, and public outdoor space. It’s a place where you can get to know your neighbors and feel like part of a community.   We delved into the fascinating history of this house, which adds to our appreciation for acquiring a historic row home. Back in 1880, Thomas W. Wallace Lived there with his family and in 1883, threw a wedding for his daughter Lizzy and Harry Davies. In 1895, a local bartender moved in, promoting himself as a good mixer who speaks Polish and German. As the 1900s rolled in, Irish and Russian laborers moved in, leaving their mark on its story.   So there you have it, a house that's so much more than a house; it’s a 10-foot wide, impeccably designed lifestyle upgrade. Come claim your slice of paradise in Pennsport!  🏡🪄\n",

      "\tdescription: Get ready to be swept off your feet by this absolute gem of a home! Nestled in the middle of a small side street and unattached on the West side, this home has all of the extra windows and sunlight of a corner property with the privacy and charm of mid-block because of the adjoining lot that is used for private parking and will never be built on! Yes, this expanded trinity has windows on three sides, three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, an open first floor, and a large backyard with a deck and lawn. Originally built in the 1860s for workers at the navy yard that was then at the end of the block, this little workhorse has been brilliantly updated with loads of storage and original details.  The open living, dining room, and kitchen are perfect for quiet nights or hosting gatherings with friends and family. Gleaming new wood floors, floating wooden shelves for your teacup collection, and large windows make the space bright and airy. It feels minimal and modern while providing ample storage space. As you wander through the kitchen, you can head out onto your very own decked-in yard. After many trials and tribulations, the previous owners found the perfect tree that has been growing and thriving, so you get plenty of shade while you spend time outside.   Let's journey upstairs, shall we? This home is rare because it offers windows on three sides, almost unheard of in row home life. The bedrooms have tons of light streaming through. And the bathroom? It's like a moody spa: tile floors, a modern vanity with plenty of storage, and mini subway marble tiles around the tub that's just begging for a bubble bath.   Make your way to the third floor to find the two other bedrooms. The first, closest to the stairs, is perfect for your kiddo or an office. It’s on the smaller side, but the large window makes it a cheery place all day. The third bedroom is a fantastic size, easily fitting a queen bed. Two windows drench the room in light. Both bedrooms have vaulted ceilings with large lofts that could be used for storage or move beds up for the best naps. The exposed brick adds to the charming and historic feel of the home! Oh, and there's another full bathroom because this place understands vertical living.  The house itself is enough to make the move, but the neighborhood will seal the deal. Pennsport is loved for its proximity to parks, transportation (95 is just a few blocks away for easy access), waterfront running paths, not to mention coffee shops galore. As current residents of this neighborhood, we can assure you that it has so much to offer regarding food, coffee, bars, and public outdoor space. It’s a place where you can get to know your neighbors and feel like part of a community.   We delved into the fascinating history of this house, which adds to our appreciation for acquiring a historic row home. Back in 1880, Thomas W. Wallace Lived there with his family and in 1883, threw a wedding for his daughter Lizzy and Harry Davies. In 1895, a local bartender moved in, promoting himself as a good mixer who speaks Polish and German. As the 1900s rolled in, Irish and Russian laborers moved in, leaving their mark on its story.   So there you have it, a house that's so much more than a house; it’s a 10-foot wide, impeccably designed lifestyle upgrade. Come claim your slice of paradise in Pennsport!  🏡🪄\n",

Walking through the long hallways, one can imagine the petticoat/hoopskirts swinging from the giant rafters above. The space between each floor is vacuous with soaring ceilings anchored by enormous wood beams--a perfect setting for carving unique residential loft spaces. The units have at least one lofted space and most embrace the rich exposed brick of the original factory. This unit boasts tall oversized windows, allowing east light to flood the space in the early hours, melting to soft natural hues later in the day. Lustrous wide plank wood floors run throughout the space, and a handsome brick wall towers along one side of the unit. A kitchen runs along the back wall with lovely espresso colored cabinets, a white subway tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances. A laundry closet with stacked units is nestled into the space next to the staircase. The dining area and living room spread out in the open floor plan comprising the main living level. The steps upstairs lead to a sleeping loft, a testament to industrial character with huge beams accenting the wood ceiling and floors. An attractive bathroom meshes contemporary style with old world character and features a white subway tile surround over a tub and shower combination within the natural wood space.   Old City is a vibrant neighborhood that showcases Philadelphia's rich history, with towering brick and concrete facades lining the streets and cobblestone alleys. It is also a hub for public transportation, making it easy to get around the city. The neighborhood is home to cultural and historic institutions, as well as a wide array of boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and retail options. It is also the site of the Annual Fringe Festival and First Fridays, where galleries open up to showcase their new exhibits. Overall, Old City provides all the benefits of an urban lifestyle with a unique historical charm.\n",
